## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to the GitHub organisation of the System Syndicates!!!
We are working on The Ambient Interfaces project, developed as part of the UQ DECO3801 course.

The Ambient Interfaces project aims to develop a simple and unobtrusive calendar and time management system
to integrate into family homes. The device and software should allow families to easily schedule activities and tasks, 
whilst utilising ambient UX design principles for the purpose of promoting social engagement.

> As this is part of a uni course, you probably won't see anything public atm, maybe come back later! ðŸ« 

## Project Features
- **Dual Functionality**: The chess board serves as a standard game board but seamlessly converts into a digital calendar when activated by an NFC tag.
- **Personalized Interaction**: Users can trigger the calendar mode by placing a specific NFC tag on the board, displaying their individual schedules and tasks
- (as well as anything their family members want to share)
- **Ambient UX Design**: The transition between chess and calendar modes is designed to be smooth and unobtrusive, maintaining the board's aesthetic appeal in both modes.
- **Modular Design**: The board's modular structure allows for easy customization and integration of additional features or future expansions.
